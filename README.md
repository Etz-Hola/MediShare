Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based healthcare data exchange system using modular smart contracts. It enables secure sharing, storage, and governance of medical records through role-based access control and tokenized incentives.

The Decentralized Healthcare Data Exchange is a platform that empowers patients with ownership and control over their medical records while enabling secure, transparent data sharing between healthcare providers, insurers, and researchers. Built on blockchain technology, the platform ensures privacy, accuracy, and accessibility through cryptographic permissions and decentralized storage. Tokenized incentives encourage patients to share anonymized data with researchers, fostering medical advancements while safeguarding personal information.
This platform is designed for patients, healthcare providers, insurers, and researchers, fostering trust and collaboration in the healthcare ecosystem.

Key Features:
- **Decentralized Data Management**: Store medical records on IPFS with encrypted access.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Manage access permissions for patients, doctors, researchers, and insurers.
- **Tokenized Incentives**: Reward data-sharing participants using an ERC20 token.
- **Platform Governance**: Enable stakeholders to propose and vote on system updates.
- **Emergency Access**: Time-limited permissions for urgent situations.
